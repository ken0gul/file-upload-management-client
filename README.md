# React App with ContextAPI, Tailwind CSS, and Axios

This is a React application that demonstrates the usage of ContextAPI for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Axios for fetching data from a REST API. The data fetched from the API is displayed in the UI, and it is assumed that the API is implemented using Spring Boot, and the images are stored in AWS S3.

## Features

- **ContextAPI**: Manages the global state of the application, providing a centralized way to share data between components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for efficient styling and responsive design, allowing for rapid development and customization of UI components.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to the backend REST API, facilitating the retrieval and manipulation of data.
- **Integration with REST API**: Consumes data from a RESTful API implemented using Spring Boot, providing dynamic content to the application.
- **Integration with AWS S3**: Fetches images from AWS S3 for displaying in the UI.
